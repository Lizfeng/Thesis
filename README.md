Master Thesis: The Effects of Innovative Online Learning Features on Students' Educational Outcomes
Abstract
As the use of online learning resources to provide and support instruction is on the rise, a major question for scholars and educationists to address is how we can use technology to enact more effective instruction in this new online environment rather than designing online courses based on the traditional classroom model. In learning science and practice, one general challenge is how to reliably determine what are the most effective methods for supporting learning and under what circumstances do those methods work. While learning scientists are used to conduct randomized experiment trials in schools to test different education theories, the massive amount of data being collected from educational technologies may provide us an opportunity to generate new insights. In this paper, I measure the effectiveness of two innovative instruction features of an online course – the Open Learning Initiative (OLI) environment and the discussion forum – to test the application of cognitive and social cognitive learning theories in the online environment. we use a hierarchical linear model to evaluate the impact of students’ use of OLI features on their learning outcomes and get a positive result for the effectiveness of OLI. After conducting computational content analysis and centrality measurement on the discussion forum, we find that academic discussion plays an important role among students’ conversations online.
